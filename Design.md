  * [Ten design principles for Azure applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/design-principles/)
    * Design for self healing. In a distributed system, failures happen. Design your application to be self healing when failures occur.
    * Make all things redundant. Build redundancy into your application, to avoid having single points of failure.
    * Minimize coordination. Minimize coordination between application services to achieve scalability.
    * Design to scale out. Design your application so that it can scale horizontally, adding or removing new instances as demand requires.
    * Partition around limits. Use partitioning to work around database, network, and compute limits.
    * Design for operations. Design your application so that the operations team has the tools they need.
    * Use managed services. When possible, use platform as a service (PaaS) rather than infrastructure as a service (IaaS).
    * Use the best data store for the job. Pick the storage technology that is the best fit for your data and how it will be used.
    * Design for evolution. All successful applications change over time. An evolutionary design is key for continuous innovation.
    * Build for the needs of business. Every design decision must be justified by a business requirement.
