  + "The Deep Learning Virtual Machine (DLVM) is a specially configured variant of the popular Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) to make it easier to use GPU-based VM instances for rapidly training deep learning models. It is supported with either Windows 2016, or the Ubuntu DSVM as the base. The DLVM shares the same core VM images and hence all the rich toolset that is available on DSVM."
  + "The DLVM supports all NC and ND series GPU VM instances. When provisioning the DLVM, you must choose one of the locations in Azure that has GPUs"
  + "The provisioning should take about 10-20 minutes."
